# Stock-excercise

Hi Sameer,

this is task we have discussed together compare lists nested in list and if there is another with same value on index 2 as first one - first one [5] will be updated with value from the matched one[5]

It's all done using pandas library so it has to be installed before checking - including in your project (if not already done)

Code is quite simple - only few lines but I commented it directly in code for better understanding what actions ahve been taken and why so it may seem like more complicated or unclear for the first view.

Check if this makes sense for your task as discussed and feel free to let me know if you have additional questions about this.

And please do not forget to have a nice day and smile :)
